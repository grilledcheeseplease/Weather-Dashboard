## Description

Here we have a weather dashboard that will allow you to search your city and display the current weather along with a following 5 day forecast. The weather will display the day of the week along with an icon to display the weather condition. Along with providing the temperatures, you will also see the wind speed, uv index, and humidity. 

The uv index will change color depending on the intensity of the index that day. This site also utilized local storage by saving your past searches and displaying them below the search section. I have put a lot of time and love into this and I hope you enjoy your search!
